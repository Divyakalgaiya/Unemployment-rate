Project Title: Unemployment Rate Analysis by Region
Domain: Economics
Description: Track how unemployment rates change over time regionally.
Sample Analysis Goals: Compare pre- and post-crisis periods, trends by state.
Unemployment is a persistent global issue that significantly impacts economic stability, individual livelihoods, and social cohesion. The level and nature of unemployment vary across regions, driven by both global and local factors. As economies evolve, new technologies emerge, and international trade patterns shift, unemployment patterns also change, creating significant challenges for policymakers and societies.

For instance, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 led to sharp increases in unemployment across the world, particularly in developed countries.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant job losses in both developed and developing economies, with vulnerable sectors such as hospitality, tourism, and retail experiencing the most severe impacts.
